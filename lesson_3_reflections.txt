When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How would you collaborate without using Gir or GitHub? What would be easier and what would be harder?
A: Without using Git or GitHub, definitely, will use some other avaible version control tools and they would have advantages and drawbacks. GitHub is not really that hard once learn it with focus and it's kind of convenient if I work from home and other people also working from their home that it would give us a good tool to collaborate with each other without affecting .

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A:this way can't miss other people's changes and able to know if any changes made by others.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of other?
A: Fork: 
	it's a kind of clone but it happens in github instead of local or local to remote. With Forking one can get exact same files with the other.
   Clone:
	It's to have a copy of repository from GitHub to local and/or local to GitHub.
   Branch:
	Branching can be done locally and in remote Github, to have different branches of master.

Usage:
When i want to have a copy of someone's repository in GitHub, i'd use Fork so that I can get all files I need.

When I want to get a copy of files from GitHub repository and/or I want to have a copy of files in different place of my local repo and/or I want to have a copy of repo in GitHub from my local repo, I'd use Clone.

When I want to branch out my GitHub repository, or my local repository, I'd use branch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:it might be too frequent and/or it might not neccessary to pull sometimes.
